# Orbit Wars Lab

Local tournament runner + visualizer for the
[Orbit Wars Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/orbit-wars).

Ships with 11 agents out-of-the-box (3 baselines + 7 curated rule-based
from public Kaggle notebooks + 1 PPO RL agent) and a pre-seeded TrueSkill
leaderboard. Adds a browser UI on top of the official Kaggle replay player:
live stats sidebar, click-to-select planets/fleets, multi-selection with
inbound-fleet ETAs, light/dark mode, and separate tournament formats
(round-robin + gauntlet).

## Quick start

### Option 1: Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automatylicza/orbit-wars-lab.git
cd orbit-wars-lab
docker compose up
```

Open <http://localhost:6001>. Done.

First run builds the image (~3-5 min, pulls pytorch CPU). Subsequent `up`
is instant.

**Port conflict?** Set `PORT` to anything free:
```bash
PORT=7001 docker compose up
```

**macOS / non-standard UID:** to have files written by the container owned
by your host user (not `1000`), create a `.env` once:

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # shows available overrides
echo "UID=$(id -u)" > .env    # or just do this one-liner
echo "GID=$(id -g)" >> .env
```

### Option 2: Native dev (faster iteration)

Requires **Python 3.12** + **pnpm** (`npm i -g pnpm`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/automatylicza/orbit-wars-lab.git
cd orbit-wars-lab
bash scripts/dev.sh
```

Script creates `.venv`, installs deps, and starts backend (:8000) + Vite
viewer (:6001) with hot-reload. Open <http://localhost:6001>.

## What you get

- **11 agents ready to play** (see [`agents/`](agents/))
  - `baselines/{random,starter,nearest-sniper}` — reference agents shipped
    by Kaggle
  - `external/pilkwang-structured` — 131 votes, LB claim ~1000, most
    rule-layered reference
  - `external/tamrazov-starwars` — LB claim 1224, simulation-based
  - `external/sigmaborov-{starter,reinforce}` — rule-based with comet/sun
    awareness
  - `external/yuriygreben-architect` — physics-aware multi-phase
  - `external/ykhnkf-distance-prioritized` — distance-prioritized
    targeting, LB claim 1100
  - `external/pascal-orbitwork-v14` — fork-iteration v14
  - `external/kashiwaba-rl` — PPO neural-net policy (2000 updates
    checkpoint)
- **Pre-seeded TrueSkill leaderboard** (`runs/trueskill.json`) — local
  tournament results that accumulate as you play. Reset to empty on
  2026-04-25 after the Kaggle engine update (Bovard's 4-fold rotational
  symmetry fix per [discussion #694310](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/orbit-wars/discussion/694310));
  re-seed by running a tournament once (Tournaments → round-robin →
  pick all bundled agents → ~3 min).
- **Quick Match UI** — pick 2 or 4 agents, play a game, view replay with a
  live-stats sidebar (select any planet/fleet to see ships, production,
  inbound fleets + ETA, destination, speed).
- **Tournaments** — two formats:
  - *Round-robin* (every pair ×K games)
  - *Gauntlet* (one challenger vs the rest ×K games) — useful when you add
    your own agent and want fast relative rating.
- **Replay library** — combined view of local tournament replays + any
  Kaggle episodes you import (paste a Kaggle URL).
- **Kaggle integration (optional)** — wire up your own Kaggle API token
  through the Settings tab to browse your own leaderboard submissions and
  push new ones directly from the UI. The token stays on your host machine
  at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (chmod 600); see [Kaggle integration](#kaggle-integration)
  below for setup.

Everything lives in one Python process (FastAPI backend) serving the Vite
frontend as static files — no separate node runtime in production.

---

## Adding your own agent

```bash
cp -r agents/baselines/starter agents/mine/v1-my-bot
# edit agents/mine/v1-my-bot/main.py — replace the `def agent(obs)` body
```

The `./agents` folder is mounted into the container as a live volume, so
changes are picked up immediately — no `docker compose build` needed.
Refresh the browser, then in *Quick Match → Picker → mine* you'll see
your agent.

For a full benchmark, run a Gauntlet tournament with your agent as the
challenger (*Tournaments → Shape: gauntlet → Challenger: mine/v1-my-bot*).

CLI equivalent (works inside the container too — `docker compose exec app
orbit-wars-tournament gauntlet ...`):

```bash
python -m orbit_wars_app.tournament gauntlet mine/v1-my-bot --games-per-pair 10
```

## Where your data lives

Both Docker and native dev write to **your host filesystem** — everything
persists across container restarts / clones / rebuilds:

| Folder | What's there | Edited by |
|---|---|---|
| `./agents/` | 9 bundled agents + anything you drop in `mine/` | you |
| `./runs/trueskill.json` | TrueSkill leaderboard (seeded, live-updated) | app |
| `./runs/<date-id>/` | Tournament metadata + match results | app |
| `./runs/<date-id>/replays/*.json` | Replay for each match | app |

Delete `runs/` if you want to wipe ratings + history and start fresh.
Your agents are untouched.

## Kaggle integration

The **Submissions** tab (and its "Submit new agent" flow) needs your own
Kaggle API token. Without one it shows a banner pointing to Settings —
the rest of the app (Quick Match, Tournaments, local Leaderboard, Replays)
works fine without any Kaggle auth.

### Get a token

1. Sign in at [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) and open
   [kaggle.com/settings/account](https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account).
2. Scroll to **API**. Two formats are accepted:
   - **New format (recommended):** click *"Generate API Token"* — copy the
     `KGAT_…` string shown on screen.
   - **Legacy format:** if Kaggle still offers *"Create New Token"*, use
     that — it downloads a `kaggle.json` file.
3. Accept the [Orbit Wars competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/orbit-wars/rules)
   so the token can list your submissions.

### Save it

**Via the UI (recommended):** open **Settings → Kaggle integration**,
paste either the bare `KGAT_…` token or the contents of `kaggle.json`,
click **Test & save**. The backend validates against Kaggle's API and
writes the resolved credentials to `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (chmod 600).

**Via env vars (CI-friendly):** set `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY`
before starting the backend. Env vars win over the file at Kaggle SDK
read time — the Settings tab reflects this with a "via env vars" badge
and hides write buttons (you can't mutate another process's environment).

### Docker

The token file isn't mounted by default — uncomment one of the
`.kaggle/` volume lines in `docker-compose.yml` to pick either:

- `~/.kaggle:/home/app/.kaggle` — reuse the token you already have for
  the `kaggle` CLI on the host
- `./.kaggle-data:/home/app/.kaggle` — keep a separate per-project token
  that lives next to the compose file

Without a mount, tokens pasted in Settings vanish on container restart.

### Privacy

The token never leaves your machine except when the app talks to
`kaggle.com` directly on your behalf (listing submissions, uploading a
new one). The backend does not echo the token back to the browser —
status responses only contain the username.

Forked agent subprocesses run with `KAGGLE_*` environment variables
stripped, so third-party agent code in `agents/external/` cannot read
your token via `os.environ`. The token still lives on disk at
`~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (chmod 600), readable by any process running
as your user — that is a host-level boundary, not an app-level one.

## Architecture

```
viewer/              Vite + TypeScript SPA (vanilla DOM, no framework)
orbit_wars_app/      FastAPI backend + tournament runner (Python 3.12)
web/core/            Vendored @kaggle-environments/core (React replay player)
agents/
  baselines/         Reference agents (tracked in git)
  external/          Curated public notebooks (tracked in git)
  mine/              Your agents go here
runs/
  trueskill.json     Persistent TrueSkill state (seeded snapshot)
```

`docker-compose.yml` runs a single multi-stage image:

1. Node builder → `viewer/dist`
2. Python runtime → serves both API and the static viewer on port 8000
   (published as 6001)

## Credits

Rule-based external agents are redistributed from their authors' public
Kaggle notebooks (links + versions in each agent's `agent.yaml`). Only the
vendored Kaggle core and viewer code are original to this repo.

If you're an author and want your agent removed, open an issue.
